                    V8 used to have two compilers
                    Before version 5.9 of V8 came out (released earlier this year), the engine used two compilers:
                    
                    full-codegen — a simple and very fast compiler that produced simple and relatively slow machine code.
                    Crankshaft — a more complex (Just-In-Time) optimizing compiler that produced highly-optimized code.
            </pre>
            The V8 Engine also uses several threads internally:
            <ol>
                <li>The main thread does what you would expect: fetch your code, compile it and then execute it</li>    
                <li> There’s also a separate thread for compiling, 
                    so that the main thread can keep executing while the former is optimizing the code</li>
                <li>A Profiler thread that will tell the runtime on which methods we spend a lot of time so that Crankshaft can optimize them</li>    
                <li>A few threads to handle Garbage Collector sweeps</li>                           
            </ol>
            <pre>
                    When first executing the JavaScript code, V8 leverages full-codegen which directly translates the parsed JavaScript 
                    into machine code without any transformation. 
                    This allows it to start executing machine code very fast. 
                    Note that V8 does not use intermediate bytecode representation this way removing the need for an interpreter.

                    When your code has run for some time, the profiler thread has gathered enough data to 
                    tell which method should be optimized.
                    
                    Next, Crankshaft optimizations begin in another thread. 
                    It translates the JavaScript abstract syntax tree to a high-level static single-assignment (SSA) 
                    representation called Hydrogen and tries to optimize that Hydrogen graph. 
                    Most optimizations are done at this level.

                event loop will pick up a new task from a Task queue only when call stack is empty and 
                there is nothing to execute in a micro task queue. Let’s assume, there are 3 tasks in Task queue, T1, T2 and T3. 
                Task T1 has one task(say — setTimeout(T4, 0)) and two micro tasks(say promises — M1, M2). 
                When task T1 is executed in the call stack, it will encounter setTimeout(…) and 
                delegates it to runtime to handle its callback. Runtime will queue T4 in aTask queue. 
                When engine encounters promise 1, it will queue its callback (M1) to micro task queue. 
                Likewise, when it encounters another promise 2 object, it will queue it in a micro task queue. 
                Now call stack becomes clear, so before picking up task T2 from the Task queue, 
                event loop will execute all the callbacks (M1, M2) queued in micro task queue. 
                Once micro tasks are executed in a call stack and stack is cleared, it is ready for Task T2.

                Callbacks queued in task queue are executed in first-come-first-service order and browser may render between them (Eg. DOM manipulation, changing html styles etc).

                Callbacks queued in Micro task queue are executed in first-come-first-service order, but at the end of every task from the task queue (only if call stack is empty). As mentioned above in the event loop’s pseudo code, Micro tasks are processed at the end of each task.
// Popular JS engines(Eg. google chrome's V8 engine, Mozilla's SpiderMonkey etc) 
// implements event loop using C++, which means code snippet below is executed synchronously
while(true) {
    // Each iteration of this loop is called an event loop 'tick'
    task = eventLoop.nextTask();
    
    if (task) {
     // First: A task from the Task queue is executed
        task.execute();
    }
    
    // Second: All the tasks in the Micro task queue are executed
    eventLoop.executeMicrotasks();
    
    // Third: It will check if there is someting to render, eg. DOM changes, request animation frame etc
    // and renders in browser if required
    if (eventLoop.needsRendering())
        eventLoop.render();
