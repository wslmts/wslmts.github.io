                    V8 used to have two compilers
                    Before version 5.9 of V8 came out (released earlier this year), the engine used two compilers:
                    
                    full-codegen — a simple and very fast compiler that produced simple and relatively slow machine code.
                    Crankshaft — a more complex (Just-In-Time) optimizing compiler that produced highly-optimized code.
            </pre>
            The V8 Engine also uses several threads internally:
            <ol>
                <li>The main thread does what you would expect: fetch your code, compile it and then execute it</li>    
                <li> There’s also a separate thread for compiling, 
                    so that the main thread can keep executing while the former is optimizing the code</li>
                <li>A Profiler thread that will tell the runtime on which methods we spend a lot of time so that Crankshaft can optimize them</li>    
                <li>A few threads to handle Garbage Collector sweeps</li>                           
            </ol>
            <pre>
                    When first executing the JavaScript code, V8 leverages full-codegen which directly translates the parsed JavaScript 
                    into machine code without any transformation. 
                    This allows it to start executing machine code very fast. 
                    Note that V8 does not use intermediate bytecode representation this way removing the need for an interpreter.

                    When your code has run for some time, the profiler thread has gathered enough data to 
                    tell which method should be optimized.
                    
                    Next, Crankshaft optimizations begin in another thread. 
                    It translates the JavaScript abstract syntax tree to a high-level static single-assignment (SSA) 
                    representation called Hydrogen and tries to optimize that Hydrogen graph. 
                    Most optimizations are done at this level.
