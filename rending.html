                <h2>css rendering stage</h2>
            <ol>     
                <li>After the browser computes which styles apply to which elements on the page, it needs to translate those styles into pixels on the screen. 
                    This is the process of rendering, which can be broken down into three stages: <em class="red">layout, paint, and composite</em>.
                </li>          
                <li>    
                <h3>LAYOUT</h3>
                In the first stage, layout, the browser calculates how much space each element is going to take on the screen. 
                Because of the way the document flow works, 
                the size and position of one element can influence the size and position of countless other elements on the page. This stage sorts that all out.
                Any time you change the width or height of an element, or adjust its position properties (like top or left), the element’s layout must be recomputed. 
                This is also done if an element is inserted into or removed from the DOM by JavaScript. 
                When a layout change occurs, the browser then must reflow the page,
                recomputing the layout of all other elements that are moved or resized as a result of the change.
                
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3>PAINT</h3>
                After layout comes painting. This is the process of filling in pixels: text is drawn; images and borders and shadows are all colored. 
                This is not physically displayed on the screen, but rather drawn into memory. Portions of the page are painted into layers.
                If you change the background color of an element, for instance, it must be repainted. But, 
                because the background color has no impact on the position or sizing of any elements on the page, 
                layout doesn’t need to be recalculated to account for this change. 
                Changing a background color is less computationally intensive than changing the size of an element.
                Under the right conditions, an element on the page can be promoted into its own layer. When this happens, 
                it’s painted separately from the other layer(s) on the page. Browsers can take this layer and send it to the computer’s GPU (graphics processing unit) for rendering,
                rather than painting it on the main CPU like the main layer. This is beneficial because the GPU is highly optimized to do this sort of computation.
                This is often referred to as hardware acceleration because it relies on a piece of the computer’s hardware to give a boost to the rendering speed. 
                Having more layers means more memory use; but, in return, it can speed up the processing time of rendering.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>COMPOSITE</h3>
                    In the composite stage, the browser takes all of the layers that have been painted and draws them into the final image that’ll be displayed onscreen. 
                    These are drawn in a certain order so that the correct layers appear in front of other layers, in cases where they overlap.
                    Two properties, opacity and transform, when changed, result in a much faster rendering time. When you change one of these on an element, 
                    the browser can promote that element to its own paint layer and use GPU acceleration. Because the element is in its own layer, 
                    the main layer won’t change during the animation and won’t require repeated re-painting.
                    When making a one-time change to the page, this optimization generally doesn’t make a noticeable difference. 
                    But when the change is part of an animation, the screen needs to be updated dozens of times a second; in which case, speed matters. 
                    Most screens refresh 60 times per second. Ideally, changes during animation should be recomputed at least this fast to produce the most fluid motion possible onscreen. 
                    The more work the browser has to do for each recalculation, the harder this speed is to achieve.

                    <h5>Controlling paint layers with will-change</h5>
                    Browsers have come a long way with optimizing the rendering process, segmenting elements into layers as best they can. 
                    If you animate the transform or opacity property on an element, modern browsers, in order to make the animation smooth, 
                    generally make good decisions based on a number of factors, including system resources. 
                    But, occasionally, you might encounter choppy or flickering animations.
                    If you experience this, you can use a property called will-change to exert control over the render layers. 
                    This property indicates to the browser, ahead of time, that it should expect a certain property on the element to change. 
                    This usually means the element will be promoted to its own paint layer. 
                    For example, applying will-change: transform indicates you expect to change the transform property for that element.
                    it states that only 3D transforms promote an element to its own layer. 
                    This is no longer the case; the latest browsers now use GPU acceleration for 2D transforms as well.
